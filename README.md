# Project-Euler
This repository is where i will put the files that answers the problems posted in www.projecteuler.net, all the answers are coded in Ruby.
In this moment im doing this for training my Ruby skills, so the scripts wont be
fully optimized, they will contain more code than they need to solve the problem
or even more options in it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the number of the problems answered listed as they are in Project Euler's
page:

1 - Multiples of 3 and 5.	2 - Even Fibonacci numbers.	4 - Largest Palindrome
Product.	5 - Smallest Multiple*.		6 - SumSquareDifference
